      Checking your benefits can help you avoid cost surprises, so it's good to review what's covered and what’s not before you make an appointment.

      - Log in to [myuhc.com](https://www.myuhc.com/?srcName=MR_FAQ) and go to Benefits & Coverage to review what's covered under your plan.
      - If you want a copy of your coverage documents mailed to you, call the phone number on your health plan ID card and ask us to send you a copy.
